# Retro Lovers United

This is a site for dedicated users of the now very old Amiga-line of computers where they can get help, tips, and ideas of things to do with their beloved antiques.
Mostly just as a fun hobby, but maybe find some small niche where it can still be useful.

The site is written using HTML, CSS, Django, Python, and MD Bootstrap (Material Design Bootstrap)
