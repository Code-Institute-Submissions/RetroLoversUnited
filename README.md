# Retro Lovers United

This is a site for dedicated users of the now very old Amiga-line of computers where they can get help, tips, and ideas of things to do with their beloved antiques.
Mostly just as a fun hobby, but maybe find some small niche where it can still be useful.

The site is written using HTML, CSS, Django, Python, and MD Bootstrap (Material Design Bootstrap)

# Main Page

When the site is launched, the screen is essentially divided into three parts.

![navbar](https://github.com/jonthorell/RetroLoversUnited/blob/main/static/images/readme-files/navbar.PNG?raw=true)

The navbar will of course always be visible no matter where you are on the page. The beachball on the far left takes you back to the homepage (the icon itself comes from the very first
demo released for the Amiga 1000 back in 1985 to showcase some of what it could do). Categories is a drop-down menu where you can choose which category of articles you want to view.
Contact and abouts are just links. Create Article and Admin will not be visible unless you are logged in with sufficient rights.

On the right hand side, the bell indicates whether you have unread notifications (for example, a comment has just been approved). It also acts as a drop-down menu. This icon will also not be shown if you
are not logged in.

The avatar finally will just show a generic one if you are not logged in. Depending on whether you are logged in or out, the menu it offers will offer you either:
* Create Account
* Login

Or:

* Logout

![landing-page](https://github.com/jonthorell/RetroLoversUnited/blob/main/static/images/readme-files/landing_page.PNG?raw=true)

The landing page is essentially just a welcome page, but with links to three latest articles added to the site.

![footer](https://github.com/jonthorell/RetroLoversUnited/blob/main/static/images/readme-files/footer.png?raw=true)

The copyright message in the footer will be hidden on smaller screens so the most important thing here is highlighted, the social media icons.
JUst a few that I deemed most suitable for a community site. The URLs for twitter and youtube are search strings into respective platform with
a relevant searchphrase. Github leads straight to this repository.
